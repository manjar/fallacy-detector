	<string>Some people say that there are only two kinds of readers: those who love fiction and those who prefer non-fiction. If you don’t enjoy reading novels, then clearly you must dislike all stories altogether. But honestly, anyone who truly appreciates literature would never choose non-fiction over a good novel.
Others argue that reading for pleasure is pointless because there are more important things to worry about in life, like solving world hunger or curing diseases. However, critics of reading often claim that readers just want to avoid real responsibilities, which is an unfair characterization.
Of course, some might say they enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, but if someone claims to love books yet doesn’t own a large personal library, can they really be considered a true reader? After all, real readers always have shelves full of books at home.</string>
	<string>Some believe that if you don’t exercise first thing in the morning, you might as well not bother working out at all. After all, real fitness enthusiasts are always up at dawn, jogging in the park. If you prefer evening workouts, you’re probably just making excuses.
People who skip morning exercise often say they’re too busy, but that’s just laziness disguised as productivity. Besides, if morning exercise were truly optional, why do so many successful athletes train early?
Of course, some folks claim they get better results from afternoon sessions, but if afternoon workouts were effective, everyone would be doing them. Clearly, morning exercise is the only way to go.</string>
	<string>If you don’t bake your own bread, you’re not really interested in healthy eating. After all, people who care about their diet always make everything from scratch. Store-bought bread is just for people who don’t care what they eat.
Some people argue that homemade bread takes too much time, but that’s just an excuse to avoid learning new skills. Besides, if you really valued your health, you’d make the effort.
Of course, there are people who say they’re too busy or that store-bought bread is just as good, but if store-bought bread were truly healthy, why do so many nutritionists recommend baking at home? Clearly, homemade is the only sensible choice.</string>
	<string>There are only two types of workers: those with spotless desks and those who can’t get anything done. If your desk is messy, you’re obviously not productive.
People who defend cluttered desks say that messiness is a sign of creativity, but that’s just a myth. If a clean desk didn’t matter, why do so many successful people keep theirs tidy?
Even if someone claims to work well in a mess, can they really be considered organized? True professionals always keep their workspace immaculate.</string>
	<string>Anyone who doesn’t learn to play a musical instrument as a child will never truly appreciate music. If you didn’t take lessons growing up, you missed your chance to understand what music is really about.
Some people say it’s never too late to learn, but if that were true, we’d see more adults picking up instruments and becoming great musicians. Besides, those who claim to enjoy music without playing an instrument are just pretending.
Of course, some adults do learn to play, but if you weren’t passionate about music as a child, you’re not a real music lover. After all, true music lovers start young.</string>
	<string>If you’re not drinking at least eight glasses of water a day, you’re not taking care of your health. People who drink less are just ignoring what their bodies need.
Some claim that other beverages can hydrate you just as well, but that’s just misinformation spread by people who don’t care about their well-being. If water weren’t the best, why would doctors always recommend it?
Of course, some people say they feel fine with less water, but if they really understood health, they’d follow the eight-glass rule. Clearly, there’s only one healthy way to stay hydrated.</string>

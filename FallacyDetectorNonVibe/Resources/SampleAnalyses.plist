		<string>There are only two types of workers: those with spotless desks and those who can’t get anything done. If your desk is messy, you’re obviously not productive.
People who defend cluttered desks say that messiness is a sign of creativity, but that’s just a myth. If a clean desk didn’t matter, why do so many successful people keep theirs tidy?
Even if someone claims to work well in a mess, can they really be considered organized? True professionals always keep their workspace immaculate.</string>
